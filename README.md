## Superior Colliculus Fusion (SCF)
This repo contains a fully integratable Keras implementation of the modality fusion algorithm described in "Bio-inspired modality fusion for active speaker detection", a research paper by G. Assunção *et al*.

Succintly, this layer enables the fusion of embeddings originating from different modalities (e.g. vision, sound) according to excitation of spatially proximal neurons. The implementation is done for fusion of two modalities, although the methodology is theoretically scallable to N modalities.

If you do use this code for your own research make sure to cite the appropriate [paper available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00063):
