## Superior Colliculus Fusion (SCF)
This repo contains a fully integratable Keras implementation of the modality fusion algorithm described in "Bio-inspired modality fusion for active speaker detection", a research paper by G. Assunção *et al*.

This Keras layer enables the fusion of embeddings originating from different modalities (e.g. vision, sound). Succintly, integration of multi-source uni-sensory information occurs through feedback stimulation of spatially proximal neural regions. This implementation specifically is done for fusion of two modalities, although the methodology is theoretically scallable to N modalities.

If you do use this code or an altered version of it for your own research make sure to cite the appropriate [paper available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00063):
